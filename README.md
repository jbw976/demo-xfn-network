This is the source code repo for the demo in
https://github.com/jbw976/demo-xp-layers/tree/main/04-full-code.

This demo shows how to write a Crossplane composition function using a general
purpose programming language, specifically go. This is the far end of the "no
code" to "full code" spectrum that Crossplane supports.
